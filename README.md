# Computational Statistics Final Project
## A comparative study of the predictive analysis of logistic regression, Regression Trees and Random Forest.
---

## Overview:
The motivation behind this project is to compare the performance of logistic regression with that of the regression tree method and Random foresting and to try and estimate which would provide better results given a certain data. The base reference for this is the paper that I have chosen, “Economic, Psychological, and Sociological Determinants of Voluntary Turnover” By CHARLES W. MUELLER* AND JAMES L. PRICE, University of lowa. My aim is to study the performance of regression trees and random forests on various data and try to provide an analysis of the models performances.
