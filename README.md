# Computational Statistics Final Project
## A comparative study of the prediction of logistic regression, Regression Trees and Random Forest.
---

## Overview:
The motivation behind this project is to compare the performance of logistic regression with that of the regression tree method and Random foresting and to try and estimate which would provide better results given  certain data. The base reference for this type of data is the paper that I have chosen is - ‘Mueller, C. W., & Price, J. J. (1990). Economic, psychological, and sociological determinants of voluntary turnover. Journal of Behavioral Economics, 19(3), 321–335’. My aim is to study the prediction performance for each model based on the calculated Mean Squared Errors of Logistic Regression, Regression Trees and Random Forest based out of the data (but not a one to one replication of the data from the paper)from ‘Mueller, C. W., & Price, J. J. (1990). Economic, psychological, and sociological determinants of voluntary turnover. Journal of Behavioral Economics, 19(3), 321–335’ and try to provide an analysis of the models performances.
